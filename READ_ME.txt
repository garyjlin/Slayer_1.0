Slayer 1.0 is a 2D, side-scrolling, hack-and-slash game that features original character art and animation, 
randomized platform generation, collision physics and a real-time combat system.

You play as Slayer, a mighty warrior from a small village, on an adventure to reach Altoria, the kingdom's capital, 
in hopes of making a name for yourself. On your way to Altoria, you stumble upon unrealistically-close cliffs,
floating platforms and hungry Pac-Men that eat more than just pellets. This is your first of many challenges.
This is Slayer 1.0.
